        <p>The history of humanity spans millions of years, beginning with the emergence of early hominins in Africa. The first members of the genus Homo appeared around 2.5 million years ago, with Homo habilis considered one of the earliest human species. Over time, these early humans developed the ability to make tools, control fire, and form social structures. The most significant evolutionary leap came with Homo sapiens, who appeared around 300,000 years ago and began to spread out of Africa, eventually populating the globe.</p>
