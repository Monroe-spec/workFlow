        <p>The history of humanity spans millions of years, beginning with the emergence of early hominins in Africa. The first members of the genus Homo appeared around 2.5 million years ago, with Homo habilis considered one of the earliest human species. Over time, these early humans developed the ability to make tools, control fire, and form social structures. The most significant evolutionary leap came with Homo sapiens, who appeared around 300,000 years ago and began to spread out of Africa, eventually populating the globe.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The development of agriculture around 10,000 years ago marked a pivotal moment in human history, leading to the establishment of permanent settlements and the rise of civilizations. Over the centuries, humans advanced in science, philosophy, and technology, sparking the growth of empires, trade, and cultural exchange. The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries marked another transformative period, accelerating technological innovation and shaping the modern world. Today, humanity continues to evolve, navigating the challenges of globalization, environmental sustainability, and technological advancement.</p>
